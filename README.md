Figure 1: The top 100 most confident local feature matches from a baseline implementation of project 2. In this case, 89 were correct (lines shown in green), and 11 were incorrect (lines shown in red).

Overview

The goal of this assignment is to create a local feature matching algorithm using techniques described in Szeliski chapter 7.1. The pipeline we suggest is a simplified version of the famous SIFT pipeline. The matching pipeline is intended to work for instance-level matching ‚Äì multiple views of the same physical scene.

Setup

1. Install Miniconda. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses python3 anyways.

2. Download and extract the project starter code.

3. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed ‚ÄúConda prompt‚Äù to run the command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command, Modify the command based on your OS (linux, mac, or win): conda env create -f

proj2_env_&lt;OS&gt;.yml

4. This will create an environment named ‚Äúcs6476 proj2‚Äù. Activate it using the Windows command, activate cs6476_proj2 or the MacOS / Linux command, conda activate cs6476_proj2 or source activate cs6476_proj2

6. Run the notebook using jupyter notebook ./proj2_code/proj2.ipynb

7. After implementing all functions, ensure that all sanity checks are passing by running pytest proj2_ unit_tests inside the repo folder.

8. Generate the zip folder for the code portion of your submission once you‚Äôve finished the project using python zip_submission.py ‚Äìgt_username &lt;your_gt_username&gt;

Details

For this project, you need to implement the three major steps of a local feature matching algorithm (detecting interest points, creating local feature descriptors, and matching feature vectors). We‚Äôll implement two versions of the local feature descriptor, and the code is organized as follows:

‚Ä¢ Interest point detection in part1_harris_corner.py (see Szeliski 7.1.1)

‚Ä¢ Local feature description with a simple normalized patch feature in part2_patch_descriptor.py (see Szeliski 7.1.2)

‚Ä¢ Feature matching in part3_feature_matching.py (see Szeliski 7.1.3)

‚Ä¢ Local feature description with the SIFT feature in part4_sift_descriptor.py (see Szeliski 7.1.2)

1 Interest point detection (part1_harris_corner.py)

The auto-correlation matrix A can be computed as (Equation 7.8 of book, p. 404)

(1)

where we have replaced the weighted summations with discrete convolutions with the weighting kernel w (Equation 7.9, p. 405).

The Harris corner score R is derived from the auto-correlation matrix A as:

R = det(A) ‚àí Œ± ¬∑ trace(A)2 (2)

with Œ± = 0.06.

Algorithm 1: Harris Corner Detector

Compute the horizontal and vertical derivatives Ix and Iy of the image by convolving the original image with a Sobel filter;

Compute the three images corresponding to the outer products of these gradients. (The matrix A is symmetric, so only three entries are needed.);

Convolve each of these images with a larger Gaussian.;

Compute a scalar interest measure using the formulas (Equation 2) discussed above.;

Find local maxima above a certain threshold and report them as detected feature point locations.;

To implement the Harris corner detector, you will have to fill out the following methods in part1_harris_corner .py:

‚Ä¢ compute_image_gradients(): Computes image gradients using the Sobel filter.

‚Ä¢ get_gaussian_kernel_2D_pytorch(): Creates a 2D Gaussian kernel (this is essentially the same as your Gaussian kernel method from project 1).

‚Ä¢ second_moments(): Computes the second moments of the input image. You will need to use your get_gaussian_kernel_2D_pytorch() method.

‚Ä¢ maxpool_numpy(): Performs the maxpooling operation using just NumPy. This manual implementation will help you understand what‚Äôs happening in the next step.

‚Ä¢ nms_maxpool_pytorch(): Performs non-maximum suppression using max-pooling. You can use PyTorch max-pooling operations for this.

‚Ä¢ remove_border_vals(): Removes values close to the border that we can‚Äôt create a useful SIFT window around.

The starter code gives some additional suggestions. You do not need to worry about scale invariance or keypoint orientation estimation for your baseline Harris corner detector. The original paper by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens describing their corner detector can be found here.

2 Part 2: Local feature descriptors (part2_patch_descriptor.py)

To get your matching pipeline working quickly, you will implement a bare-bones feature descriptor in part2_patch_descriptor.py using normalized, grayscale image intensity patches as your local feature. See Szeliski 7.1.2 for more details when coding compute_normalized_patch_descriptors()

Choose the top-left option of the 4 possible choices for center of a square window, as shown in Figure

2.

Figure 2: For this example of a 6 √ó 6 window, the yellow cells could all be considered the center. Please choose the top left (marked ‚ÄúC‚Äù) as the center throughout this project.

3 Part 3: Feature matching (part3_feature_matching.py)

4 Part 4: SIFT Descriptor (part4_sift_descriptor.py)

Regarding Histograms SIFT relies upon histograms. An unweighted 1D histogram with 3 bins could have bin edges of [0,2,4,6]. If x = [0.0,0.1,2.5,5.8,5.9], and the bins are defined over half-open intervals [eleft,eright) with edges e, then the histogram h = [2,1,2].

A weighted 1D histogram with the same 3 bins and bin edges has each item weighted by some value. For example, for an array x = [0.0,0.1,2.5,5.8,5.9], with weights w = [2,3,1,0,0], and the same bin edges ([0,2,4,6]), hw = [5,1,0]. In SIFT, the histogram weight at a pixel is the magnitude of the image gradient at that pixel.

In part4_sift_descriptor.py, you will have to implement the following:

‚Ä¢ get_magnitudes_and_orientations(): Retrieves gradient magnitudes and orientations of the image.

‚Ä¢ get_gradient_histogram_vec_from_patch(): Retrieves a feature consisting of concatenated histograms.

‚Ä¢ get_feat_vec(): Gets the adjusted feature from a single point.

‚Ä¢ get_SIFT_descriptors(): Gets all feature vectors corresponding to our interest points from an image.

5 Writeup

For this project (and all other projects), you must do a project report using the template slides provided to you. Do not change the order of the slides or remove any slides, as this will affect the grading process on Gradescope and you will be deducted points. In the report you will describe your algorithm and any decisions you made to write your algorithm a particular way. Then you will show and discuss the results of your algorithm. The template slides provide guidance for what you should include in your report. A good writeup doesn‚Äôt just show results ‚Äì it tries to draw some conclusions from the experiments. You must convert the slide deck into a PDF for your submission.

If you choose to do anything extra, add slides after the slides given in the template deck to describe your implementation, results, and analysis. Adding slides in between the report template will cause issues with Gradescope, and you will be deducted points. You will not receive full credit for your extra credit implementations if they are not described adequately in your writeup. In addition, when turning in the PDF writeup to gradescope, please match the pages of the writeup to the appropriate sections of the rubric.

Using the starter code (proj2.ipynb)

The top-level iPython notebook, proj2.ipynb, provided in the starter code includes file handling, visualization, and evaluation functions for you, as well as calls to placeholder versions of the three functions listed above.

For the Notre Dame image pair there is a ground truth evaluation in the starter code as well. evaluate_ correspondence() will classify each match as correct or incorrect based on hand-provided matches (see show_ground_truth_corr() for details). The starter code also contains ground truth correspondences for two other image pairs (Mount Rushmore and Episcopal Gaudi). You can test on those images by uncommenting the appropriate lines in proj2.ipynb.

As you implement your feature matching pipeline, you should see your performance according to evaluate_ correspondence() increase. Hopefully you find this useful, but don‚Äôt overfit to the initial Notre Dame image pair, which is relatively easy. The baseline algorithm suggested here and in the starter code will give you full credit and work faily well on these Notre Dame images, but additional image pairs provided in extra_data.zip are more difficult. They might exhibit more viewpoint, scale, and illumination variation.

Potentially useful NumPy and Pytorch functions

From Numpy: np.argsort(), np.arctan2(), np.concatenate(), np.fliplr(), np.flipud(), np.histogram(), np.hypot(), np.linalg.norm(), np.linspace(), np.newaxis, np.reshape(), np.sort().

From Pytorch: torch.argsort(), torch.arange(), torch.from_numpy(), torch.median(), torch.nn.functional .conv2d(), torch.nn.Conv2d(), torch.nn.MaxPool2d(), torch.nn.Parameter, torch.stack().

For the optional, extra-credit vectorized SIFT implementation, you might find torch.meshgrid, torch.norm, torch.cos, torch.sin.

We want you to build off of your Project 1 expertise. Please use torch.nn.Conv2d or torch.nn.functional .conv2d instead of convolution/cross-correlation functions from other libraries (e.g., cv.filter2D(), scipy. signal.convolve()).

Forbidden functions

(You can use these OpenCV, Sci-kit Image, and SciPy functions for testing, but not in your final code). cv2.

getGaussianKernel(),np.gradient(), cv2.Sobel(), cv2.SIFT(), cv2.SURF(), cv2.BFMatcher(), cv2.BFMatcher ().match(), cv2.BFMatcher().knnMatch(), cv2.FlannBasedMatcher().knnMatch(), cv2.HOGDescriptor(), cv2. cornerHarris(), cv2.FastFeatureDetector(), cv2.ORB(), skimage.feature, skimage.feature.hog(), skimage. feature.daisy, skimage.feature.corner_harris(), skimage.feature.corner_shi_tomasi(), skimage.feature .match_descriptors(), skimage.feature.ORB(), cv.filter2D(), scipy.signal.convolve().

We haven‚Äôt enumerated all possible forbidden functions here, but using anyone else‚Äôs code that performs interest point detection, feature computation, or feature matching for you is forbidden.

Tips, tricks, and common problems

‚Ä¢ Make sure you‚Äôre not swapping x and y coordinates at some point. If your interest points aren‚Äôt showing up where you expect, or if you‚Äôre getting out of bound errors, you might be swapping x and y coordinates. Remember, images expressed as NumPy arrays are accessed image[y, x].

Bells &amp; whistles (extra points) / Extra Credit

Implementation of bells &amp; whistles can increase your grade on this project by up to 10 points (potentially over 100). The max score for all students is 110.

Local feature description

‚Ä¢ up to 3 pts: The simplest thing to do is to experiment with the numerous SIFT parameters: How big should each feature be? How many local cells should it have? How many orientations should each histogram have? Different normalization schemes can have a significant effect as well. Don‚Äôt get lost in parameter tuning though.

‚Ä¢ up to 10 pts: Implement a vectorized version of SIFT that runs in under 5 seconds, with at least 80% accuracy on the Notre Dame image pair.
